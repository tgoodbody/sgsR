\usage{
sample_ahels(
  mraster,
  existing,
  nQuant = 10,
  nSamp = NULL,
  threshold = 0.9,
  tolerance = 0,
  matrices = NULL,
  plot = FALSE,
  details = FALSE,
  filename = NULL,
  overwrite = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mraster}{spatRaster. ALS metrics raster.}

\item{existing}{sf 'POINT'.  Existing plot network.}

\item{nQuant}{Numeric. Number of quantiles to divide covariates and samples into. Quantiles that do not
cover at least 1 percent of the area of interest will be excluded and be returned as \code{NA}.}

\item{nSamp}{Numeric. Maximum number of new samples to allocate.}

\item{threshold}{Numeric. Sample quantile ratio threshold. After the threshold \code{default = 0.9} is reached,
no additional samples will be added. Values close to 1 can cause the algorithm to continually loop.}

\item{tolerance}{Numeric. Allowable tolerance (<= 0.1 (10%)) around quantile density of 1. If \code{nSamp} is used samples will be
added until the \code{1 - tolerance} density is reached. If \code{threshold} is used, samples will be added until the 
\code{threshold - tolerance} value is reached. This parameter allows the user to define a buffer around desired quantile densities
to permit the algorithm to not add additional samples if quantile density is very close to 1, or user-defined \code{threshold}.}

\item{matrices}{List. Quantile and covariance matrices generated from \code{calculate_pop(mraster = mraster, nQuant = nQuant)}.
Both \code{mraster} & \code{nQuant} inputs must be the same to supply the covariance matrix. Supplying the matrix allows users
with very large \code{mrasters} to pre-process the covariance matrix to avoid longer sampling processing times.}

\item{plot}{Logical. Plots samples of type `existing` (if provided; croses) and `new` (circles) along with \code{mraster}.}

\item{details}{Logical. If \code{FALSE} (default) output is sf object of
systematic samples. If \code{TRUE} returns a list of sf objects where \code{tessellation}
is the tessellation grid for sampling, and \code{samples} are the systematic samples.}

\item{filename}{Character. Path to write output samples.}

\item{overwrite}{Logical. Choice to overwrite existing \code{filename} if it exists.}
}
\value{
Returns sf point object with existing samples and supplemental samples added by the ahels algorithm.

\description{
Perform the adapted Hypercube Evaluation of a Legacy Sample (ahels) algorithm using
existing site data and raster metrics. New samples are allocated based on quantile ratios between
the existing sample and covariate dataset.
}
\note{
Messages in the algorithm will state that samples have been added to under-represented quantiles. The number between
square brackets that follow represent the matrix row and column respectively that can be printed using \code{details = TRUE}.

In some cases, generally when a single metric is used as \code{mraster}, sampling ratios all be >= 1 before the 
\code{nSamp} number of samples are allocated. The algorithm will stop in this scenario.

Special thanks to Dr. Brendan Malone for the original implementation of this algorithm.
