\usage{
calculate_allocation_existing(
  existing,
  nSamp,
  allocation = "prop",
  weights = NULL,
  metric = NULL,
  force = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{existing}{sf 'POINT' or data.frame.  Existing plot network.}

\item{nSamp}{Numeric. Number of desired samples.}

\item{allocation}{Character. Allocation algorithm to be used. Either \code{prop} (default) for proportional allocation,
\code{optim} for optimal allocation (equal sampling cost), \code{equal} for equal number of samples (defined by \code{nSamp})
for each strata, or \code{"manual"} for user defined strata weights defined using \code{weights}.}

\item{weights}{Numeric. Only applicable when \code{allocation = "manual"}. Vector of weights where \code{sum(weights) == 1}. Vector length
must be equal to the number of unique strata where the first numeric value corresponds to stratum 1, second stratum 2 etc.}

\item{force}{Logical. \code{Default = FALSE} - force \code{nSamp} to be exactly the user defined value
in cases where \code{nSamp} and \code{sraster} strata count are not equally divisible. Additional samples often need to be allocated or removed
based on rounding differences resulting from proportional differences between \code{nSamp} and strata coverages in \code{sraster}.
In these instances samples are either added to strata with the lowest number of samples or are removed from strata with the highest number of samples.
Has no effect when \code{existing} is provided.}
}
\value{
Returns a data.frame of:
\itemize{
\item{strata} - Strata ID.
\item{total} - Number of samples to be allocated. Values correspond to under representation (samples needed; positive value) or over representation
(too many samples; negative value) based on the \code{nSamp} provided.
\item{need} - Required samples per strata based on allocation method. Rounded.
}
}
\description{
Determine how many samples to allocate within strata.
