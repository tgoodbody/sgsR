Currently, there are 8 functions associated with the `sample` verb in the `sgsR` package:

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(df, align = 'c')
```

## `sample_srs` {#srs .unnumbered}
We have demonstrated a simple example of using the `sample_srs()` function in `vignette("sgsR")`. We will demonstrate additional examples below. 

::: {.infobox .caution data-latex="{caution}"}
**`raster`**

The input required for `sample_srs()` is a `raster`. This means that `sraster` and `mraster` are supported for this function.
:::

```{r,warning=F,message=F} 
#--- perform simple random sampling ---#
sample_srs(raster = sraster, # input sraster
           nSamp = 200, # number of desired sample units
           plot = TRUE) # plot
```

```{r,warning=F,message=F} 
sample_srs(raster = mraster, # input mraster
           nSamp = 200, # number of desired sample units
           access = access, # define access road network
           mindist = 200, # minimum distance sample units must be apart from one another
           buff_inner = 50, # inner buffer - no sample units within this distance from road
           buff_outer = 200, # outer buffer - no sample units further than this distance from road
           plot = TRUE) # plot
```

## `sample_systematic` {#systematic .unnumbered}

The `sample_systematic()` function applies systematic sampling across an area with the `cellsize` parameter defining the resolution of the tessellation. The tessellation shape can be modified using the `square` parameter. Assigning `TRUE` (default) to the `square` parameter results in a regular grid and assigning `FALSE` results in a hexagonal grid. 

The location of sample units can also be adjusted using the `locations` parameter, where `centers` takes the center, `corners` takes all corners, and `random` takes a random location within each tessellation. Random start points and translations are applied when the function is called.

```{r,warning=F,message=F,eval = FALSE} 
#--- perform grid sampling ---#
sample_systematic(raster = sraster, # input sraster
                  cellsize = 1000, # grid distance
                  plot = TRUE) # plot
```

```{r,warning=F,message=F,eval = FALSE} 
#--- perform grid sampling ---#
sample_systematic(raster = sraster, # input sraster
                  cellsize = 500, # grid distance
                  square = FALSE, # hexagonal tessellation
                  location = "random", # randomly sample within tessellation
                  plot = TRUE) # plot
```      

```{r,warning=F,message=F,eval = FALSE} 
sample_systematic(raster = sraster, # input sraster
            cellsize = 500, # grid distance
            access = access, # define access road network
            buff_outer = 200, # outer buffer - no sample units further than this distance from road
            square = FALSE, # hexagonal tessellation
            location = "corners", # take corners instead of centers
            plot = TRUE)
```

## `sample_strat` {#sstrat .unnumbered}

The `sample_strat()` contains two `method`s to perform sampling:

* `"Queinnec"` - Hierarchical sampling using a focal window to isolate contiguous groups of stratum pixels, which was originally developed by Martin Queinnec.

* `"random"` - Traditional stratified random sampling. This `method` ignores much of the functionality of the algorithm to allow users the capability to use standard stratified random sampling approaches without the use of a focal window to locate contiguous stratum cells.

### `method = "Queinnec"` {#queinnec .unnumbered}

_Queinnec, M., White, J. C., & Coops, N. C. (2021). Comparing airborne and spaceborne photon-counting LiDAR canopy structural estimates across different boreal forest types. Remote Sensing of Environment, 262(August 2020), 112510._

This algorithm uses moving window (`wrow` and `wcol` parameters) to filter the input `sraster` to prioritize sample unit allocation to where stratum pixels are spatially grouped, rather than dispersed individuals across the landscape.

Sampling is performed using 2 rules:

* **Rule 1** - Sample within spatially grouped stratum pixels. Moving window defined by `wrow` and `wcol`.

* **Rule 2** - If no additional sample units exist to satisfy desired sample size(`nSamp`), individual stratum pixels are sampled.

The rule applied to a select each sample unit is defined in the `rule` attribute of output samples. We give a few examples below:

```{r,warning=F,message=F} 
#--- perform stratified sampling random sampling ---#
sample_strat(sraster = sraster, # input sraster
             nSamp = 200, # desired sample size
             plot = TRUE) # plot
```

In some cases, users might want to include an `existing` sample  within the algorithm. In order to adjust the total number of sample units needed per stratum to reflect those already present in `existing`, we can use the intermediate function `extract_strata()`.

This function uses the `sraster` and `existing` sample units and extracts the stratum for each. These sample units can be included within `sample_strat()`, which adjusts total sample units required per class based on representation in `existing`.

```{r,warning=F,message=F} 
#--- extract strata values to existing samples ---#              
e.sr <- extract_strata(sraster = sraster, # input sraster
                       existing = existing) # existing samples to add strata value to

```

::: {.infobox .caution data-latex="{caution}"}
**TIP!**

`sample_strat()` requires the `sraster` input to have an attribute named `strata` and will give an error if it doesn't.
:::

```{r,warning=F,message=F} 
sample_strat(sraster = sraster, # input sraster
             nSamp = 200, # desired sample size
             access = access, # define access road network
             existing = e.sr, # existing sample with strata values
             mindist = 200, # minimum distance sample units must be apart from one another
             buff_inner = 50, # inner buffer - no sample units within this distance from road
             buff_outer = 200, # outer buffer - no sample units further than this distance from road
             plot = TRUE) # plot
```

The code in the example above defined the `mindist` parameter, which specifies the minimum euclidean distance that new sample units must be apart from one another.

Notice that the sample units have `type` and `rule` attributes which outline whether they are `existing` or `new`, and whether `rule1` or `rule2` were used to select them. If `type` is _existing_ (a user provided `existing` sample), `rule` will be _existing_ as well as seen above.

```{r,warning=F,message=F} 
sample_strat(sraster = sraster, # input
             nSamp = 200, # desired sample size
             access = access, # define access road network
             existing = e.sr, # existing samples with strata values
             include = TRUE, # include existing sample in nSamp total
             buff_outer = 200, # outer buffer - no samples further than this distance from road
             plot = TRUE) # plot
```

The `include` parameter determines whether `existing` sample units should be included in the total sample size defined by `nSamp`. By default, the `include` parameter is set as `FALSE`.

### `method = "random` {#stratrandom .unnumbered}

Stratified random sampling with equal probability for all cells (using default algorithm values for `mindist` and no use of `access` functionality). In essence this method perform the `sample_srs` algorithm for each stratum separately to meet the specified sample size.

```{r,warning=F,message=F} 
#--- perform stratified sampling random sampling ---#
sample_strat(sraster = sraster, # input sraster
             method = "random", #stratified random sampling
             nSamp = 200, # desired sample size
             plot = TRUE) # plot
```

## `sample_nc` {#nc .unnumbered}

`sample_nc()` function implements the Nearest Centroid sampling algorithm described in [Melville & Stone (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1080/00049158.2016.1218265). The algorithm uses kmeans clustering where the number of clusters (centroids) is equal to the desired sample size (`nSamp`). 

Cluster centers are located, which then prompts the nearest neighbour `mraster` pixel for each cluster to be selected (assuming default `k` parameter). These nearest neighbours are the output sample units.

```{r}
#--- perform simple random sampling ---#
sample_nc(mraster = mraster, # input
          nSamp = 25, # desired sample size
          plot = TRUE)
```
Altering the `k` parameter leads to a multiplicative increase in output sample units where total output samples = $nSamp * k$.

```{r}
#--- perform simple random sampling ---#
samples <- sample_nc(mraster = mraster, # input
                    k = 2, # number of nearest neighbours to take for each kmeans center
                    nSamp = 25, # desired sample size
                    plot = TRUE)

#--- total samples = nSamp * k (25 * 2) = 50 ---#
nrow(samples)
```

Visualizing what the kmeans centers and sample units looks like is possible when using `details = TRUE`. The `$kplot` output provides a quick visualization of where the centers are based on a scatter plot of the first 2 layers in `mraster`. Notice that the centers are well distributed in covariate space and chosen sample units are the closest pixels to each center (nearest neighbours).

```{r}
#--- perform simple random sampling with details ---#
details <- sample_nc(mraster = mraster, # input
                     nSamp = 25, # desired sample number
                     details = TRUE)

#--- plot ggplot output ---#

details$kplot
```

## `sample_clhs` {#clhs .unnumbered}

`sample_clhs()` function implements conditioned Latin hypercube (clhs) sampling methodology from the [`clhs`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=clhs/) package. 

::: {.infobox .caution data-latex="{caution}"}
**TIP!**

A number of other functions in the `sgsR` package help to provide guidance on clhs sampling including `calculate_pop()` and `calculate_lhsOpt()`. Check out these functions to better understand how sample numbers could be optimized.
:::

The syntax for this function is similar to others shown above, although parameters like `iter`, which define the number of iterations within the Metropolis-Hastings process are important to consider. In these examples we use a low `iter` value for efficiency. Default values for `iter` within the `clhs` package are 10,000.

```{r,eval = FALSE} 
sample_clhs(mraster = mraster, # input
            nSamp = 200, # desired sample size
            plot = TRUE, # plot 
            iter = 100) # number of iterations
```

```{r,warning=F,message=F,echo=F,results = FALSE} 
sample_clhs(mraster = mraster, # input
            nSamp = 200, # desired sample size
            plot = TRUE, # plot 
            iter = 100) # number of iterations
```

The `cost` parameter defines the `mraster` covariate, which is used to constrain the clhs sampling. An example could be the distance a pixel is from road `access` (e.g. from `calculate_distance()` see example below), terrain slope, the output from `calculate_coobs()`, or many others.

```{r,warning=F,message=F} 
#--- cost constrained examples ---#
#--- calculate distance to access layer for each pixel in mr ---#
mr.c <- calculate_distance(raster = mraster, # input
                           access = access, # define access road network
                           plot = TRUE) # plot

```

```{r,eval=F} 
sample_clhs(mraster = mr.c, # input
            nSamp = 250, # desired sample size
            iter = 100, # number of iterations
            cost = "dist2access", # cost parameter - name defined in calculate_distance()
            plot = TRUE) # plot
```

```{r,warning=F,message=F,echo=F,results = FALSE} 
sample_clhs(mraster = mr.c, # input
            nSamp = 250, # desired sample size
            iter = 100, # number of iterations
            cost = "dist2access", # cost parameter - name defined in calculate_distance()
            plot = TRUE) # plot
```

## `sample_balanced` {#balanced .unnumbered}

The `sample_balanced()` algorithm performs a balanced sampling methodology from the [`stratifyR / SamplingBigData`](http://www.antongrafstrom.se/balancedsampling/) packages.

```{r,warning=F,message=F} 
sample_balanced(mraster = mraster, # input
                nSamp = 200, # desired sample size
                plot = TRUE) # plot
```

```{r,warning=F,message=F} 
sample_balanced(mraster = mraster, # input
                nSamp = 100, # desired sample size
                algorithm = "lcube", # algorithm type
                access = access, # define access road network
                buff_inner = 50, # inner buffer - no sample units within this distance from road
                buff_outer = 200) # outer buffer - no sample units further than this distance from road
```

## `sample_ahels` {#ahels .unnumbered}

The `sample_ahels()` function performs the adapted Hypercube Evaluation of a Legacy Sample (ahels) algorithm using`existing` sample data and an `mraster`. New sample units are allocated based on quantile ratios between the `existing` sample and `mraster` covariate dataset.

This algorithm was adapted from that presented in the paper below, which we highly recommend.

*_Malone BP, Minansy B, Brungard C. 2019. Some methods to improve the utility of conditioned Latin hypercube sampling. PeerJ 7:e6451 DOI 10.7717/peerj.6451_*

This algorithm:

1. Determines the quantile distributions of `existing` sample units and `mraster` covariates.

2. Determines quantiles where there is a disparity between sample units and covariates.

3. Prioritizes sampling within those quantile to improve representation.

To use this function, user must first specify the number of quantiles (`nQuant`) followed by either the `nSamp` (total number of desired sample units to be added) or the `threshold` (sampling ratio vs. covariate coverage ratio for quantiles - default is 0.9) parameters.

```{r,eval = FALSE}
#--- remove `type` variable from existing  - causes plotting issues ---#

existing <- existing %>% select(-type)

sample_ahels(mraster = mraster, 
             existing = existing, # existing sample
             plot = TRUE) # plot
```

```{r,warning=F,message=F,echo=FALSE, results = FALSE}
s <- sample_ahels(mraster = mraster, 
             existing = existing) # existing samples
```
```{r,echo=FALSE}
s
```

::: {.infobox .caution data-latex="{caution}"}
**TIP!**

Notice that no `threshold`, `nSamp`, or `nQuant` were defined. That is because the default setting for `threshold = 0.9` and `nQuant = 10`.
:::


The first matrix output shows the quantile ratios between the sample and the covariates. A value of 1.0 indicates that the sample is representative of quantile coverage. Values > 1.0 indicate over representation of sample units, while < 1.0 indicate under representation.

```{r,eval = FALSE}
sample_ahels(mraster = mraster, 
             existing = existing, # existing sample
             nQuant = 20, # define 20 quantiles
             nSamp = 300) # desired sample size
```

```{r,warning=F,message=F,echo=FALSE, results = FALSE}
s <- sample_ahels(mraster = mraster, 
             existing = existing, # existing sample
             nQuant = 20, # define 20 quantiles
             nSamp = 300) # plot

```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
s
```

Notice that the total number of samples is 500. This value is the sum of existing units (200) and number of sample units defined by `nSamp = 300`.

## `sample_existing` {#samp-existing .unnumbered}

Acknowledging that `existing` sample networks exist is important. There is significant investment into these samples, and in order to keep inventories up-to-date, we often need to collect new data at these locations. The `sample_existing` algorithm provides a method for sub-sampling an `existing` sample network should the financial / logistical resources not be available to collect data at all sample units. The algorithm leverages latin hypercube sampling using the [clhs](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=clhs) package to effectively sample within an `existing` network.

The algorithm has two fundamental approaches:

1. Sample exclusively using the sample network and the attributes it contains.

2. Should `raster` information be available and co-located with the sample, use these data as population values to improve sub-sampling of `existing`.

Much like the `sample_clhs()` algorithm, users can define a `cost` parameter, which will be used to constrain sub-sampling. A cost parameter is a user defined metric/attribute such as distance from roads (e.g. `calculate_distance()`), elevation, etc.

### Basic sub-sampling of `existing`

First we can create an `existing` sample for our example. Lets imagine we have a dataset of ~900 samples, and we know we only have resources to sample 300 of them. We have some ALS data available (`mraster`), which we will use as our distributions to sample within.

```{r,warning=F,message=F}
#--- generate existing samples and extract metrics ---#
existing <- sample_srs(raster = mraster, nSamp = 900, plot = TRUE)

```
Now lets sub-sample.

```{r,warning=F,message=F}
#--- sub sample using ---#
e <- existing %>% 
  extract_metrics(mraster = mraster, existing = .)

sample_existing(existing = e, nSamp = 300, plot = TRUE)

```

::: {.infobox .caution data-latex="{caution}"}
**TIP!**

Notice that we used `extract_metrics()` after creating our existing. If the user provides a `raster` for the algorithm this isn't neccesary (its done internally). If only sample units are given, attributes must be provided and _sampling will be conducted on all included attributes_.
:::

We see from the output that we get 300 sample units that are a sub-sample of `existing`. The plotted output shows cumulative frequency distributions of the population (all `existing` samples) and the sub-sample (the 300 samples we requested).

### Sub-sampling using `raster` distributions

Our systematic sample of ~900 plots is fairly comprehensive, however we can generate a true population distribution through the inclusion of the ALS metrics in the sampling process. The metrics will be included in internal latin hypercube sampling to help guide sub-sampling of `existing`.

```{r,warning=F,message=F}
#--- sub sample using ---#
sample_existing(existing = existing, # our existing sample
                nSamp = 300, # desired sample size
                raster = mraster, # include mraster metrics to guide sampling of existing
                plot = TRUE) # plot

```
The sample distribution again mimics the population distribution quite well! Now lets try using a cost variable to constrain the sub-sample.

```{r,warning=F,message=F}
#--- create distance from roads metric ---#
dist <- calculate_distance(raster = mraster, access = access)

```

```{r,warning=F,message=F}
#--- sub sample using ---#
sample_existing(existing = existing, # our existing sample
                nSamp = 300, # desired sample size
                raster = dist, # include mraster metrics to guide sampling of existing
                cost = 4, # either provide the index (band number) or the name of the cost layer
                plot = TRUE) # plot

```

Finally, should the user wish to further constrain the sample based on `access` like other sampling approaches in `sgsR` that is also possible.

```{r,warning=F,message=F}
#--- ensure access and existing are in the same CRS ---#

sf::st_crs(existing) <- sf::st_crs(access)

#--- sub sample using ---#
sample_existing(existing = existing, # our existing sample
                nSamp = 300, # desired sample size
                raster = dist, # include mraster metrics to guide sampling of existing
                cost = 4, # either provide the index (band number) or the name of the cost layer
                access = access, # roads layer
                buff_inner = 50, # inner buffer - no sample units within this distance from road
                buff_outer = 300, # outer buffer - no sample units further than this distance from road
                plot = TRUE) # plot

```

::: {.infobox .caution data-latex="{caution}"}
**TIP!**

The greater constraints we add to sampling, the less likely we will have strong correlations between the population and sample, so its always important to understand these limitations and plan accordingly.
