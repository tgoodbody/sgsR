`sgsR` is designed to implement structurally guided sampling approaches for enhanced forest inventories. The package was designed to function using rasterized airborne laser scanning (ALS; Lidar) metrics to allow for stratification of forested areas based on structure.

## Installation :computer: {.unnumbered}

You can install the released version of sgsR from [Github](https://github.com/tgoodbody/sgsR) with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/tgoodbody/sgsR")
library(sgsR)
```

## Example usage :bar_chart: {.unnumbered}

``` r
#--- Load mraster files ---#
r <- system.file("extdata", "mraster.tif", package = "sgsR")

#--- load the mraster using the terra package ---#
mraster <- terra::rast(r)

#--- apply quantiles algorithm to mraster ---#
sraster <- strat_quantiles(mraster = mraster$zq90, # use mraster as input for stratification
                           nStrata = 4) # produce 4 strata
                        
#--- apply stratified sampling ---#
existing <- sample_strat(sraster = sraster, # use sraster as input for sampling
                         nSamp = 200, # request 200 samples
                         mindist = 100, # samples must be 100 m apart
                         plot = TRUE) # plot output

```
