## Installation :computer: {.unnumbered}

Install the stable version of [`sgsR`from CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sgsR) with:

``` r
install.packages("sgsR")
library(sgsR)
```

Install the most recent development version of [`sgsR` from Github](https://github.com/tgoodbody/sgsR) with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/tgoodbody/sgsR")
library(sgsR)
```
## Citing `sgsR` in literature

To cite `sgsR` use `citation()` from within R with:

```{r}
print(citation("sgsR"),bibtex=TRUE)
```

## Overview

`sgsR` provides a collection of stratification and sampling algorithms that use auxiliary information for allocating sample units over an areal sampling frame. ALS metrics, like those derived from the [`lidR` package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=lidR) are the intended inputs.

Other remotely sensed or auxiliary data can also be used (e.g. optical satellite imagery, climate data, drone-based products).

`sgsR` is being actively developed, so you may encounter bugs. If that happens, [please report your issue here](https://github.com/tgoodbody/sgsR/issues) by providing a reproducible example.

## Example usage :bar_chart: {.unnumbered}

``` r
#--- Load mraster files ---#
r <- system.file("extdata", "mraster.tif", package = "sgsR")

#--- load the mraster using the terra package ---#
mraster <- terra::rast(r)

#--- apply quantiles algorithm to mraster ---#
sraster <- strat_quantiles(mraster = mraster$zq90, # use mraster as input for stratification
                           nStrata = 4) # produce 4 strata
                        
#--- apply stratified sampling ---#
existing <- sample_strat(sraster = sraster, # use sraster as input for sampling
                         nSamp = 200, # request 200 samples
                         mindist = 100, # samples must be 100 m apart
                         plot = TRUE) # plot output

```

## Resources & Vignettes :books: {.unnumbered}

Check out [the package documentation](https://tgoodbody.github.io/sgsR/index.html) to see how you can use `sgsR` functions for your work.

`sgsR` was presented at the ForestSAT 2022 Conference in Berlin. [Slides for the presentation can be found here.](https://tgoodbody.github.io/sgsR-ForestSAT2022/)
